# BAMAZON

### BAMAZON is a small app which allows customers to purchase items stored in our bamazon_DB database. The app uses the Inquirer and mySQL npm packages.

1. When you start the app, Bamazon will first display all of the items we have in stock:

2. Bamazon will then ask you to enter the ID of the item for which you would like to purchase. If the iten is in stock, Bamazon will display the cost of the item, otherwise if the item is out of stock, you will be prompted to purchase another item.
